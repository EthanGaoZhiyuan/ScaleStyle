    "2.  **MTEB Leaderboard**: It consistently ranks high on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), specifically for English retrieval tasks.\n",
    "3.  **Encoder Architecture (BERT-based)**: This uses a standard BERT-like architecture with a **512 token limit**, which is sufficient for product names and descriptions. It uses `[CLS]` pooling, which is structurally more suitable for vector search than Decoder-based LLMs.\n",
